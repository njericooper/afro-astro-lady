                At an early age Anais has always  been passionate about helping others and fascinated by the zodiac. She is a self taught Astrologist based out of South Jersey who has helped many people with their own journey to self healing by informing them of the energies they possess. She continues to show the collective how they can work with their energies instead of against them. Astrology was with her every step of the way during her journey of self healing and seasons of growth.  As her life changed for the better, Anaisâ€™ drive and passion for helping the collective became fueled by wanting to inform others of how they navigate through life better with the help of astrology. She wants to show the importance of knowing yourself through the stars one spirit at a time.
